# 🦷 Dental Implant Detection GUI

The **Dental Implant Detection GUI** is a modern computer vision system designed to automatically detect and classify dental implants in radiograph images. Built using **YOLOv7** and trained on a curated dataset of ~2000 dental X-rays, the tool accurately identifies three major implant types: **Endosteal**, **Subperiosteal**, and **Zygomatic**.

## 🔑 Key Features

### ✅ **Accurate Implant Detection**

A fine-tuned YOLOv7 model provides high-precision detection for:

* **Endosteal implants**
* **Subperiosteal implants**
* **Zygomatic implants**

### 🖥️ **User-Friendly GUI**

A simple, intuitive **PyQt interface** allows users—especially dental professionals—to upload and analyze X-ray images easily.

### ⚡ **Real-Time Inference**

Fast detection and classification help streamline diagnosis and reduce analysis time.

### 🖼️ **Interactive Results**

Detected implants are highlighted and labeled directly on the radiograph image, providing clear visual insights.

### 🩺 **Improved Dental Diagnostics**

Supports dental specialists with better implant identification, aiding personalized treatment planning.
